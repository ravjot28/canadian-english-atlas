## About Canadian English Voice Map

**Canadian English Voice Map** is an interactive map that allows you to listen to sound samples submitted by users around the country as well as submit your own samples. The purpose of the map is to explore dialect variation throughout the country. Users also have the option of downloading files for their own analysis.

The map was created by the [Strathy Language Unit](http://www.queensu.ca/strathy/) at Queen's University. We welcome your feedback. Please [contact us](mailto:CVM@queensu.ca).
