      <strong>Canadian Voices Map</strong> is an interactive digital map with
      structured audio samples from around the country. The goal of the project
      is to explore dialect diversity in Canadian English. Users can listen to
      samples, download audio files and contribute their own voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following screens, you will be asked to answer some background
      questions about yourself and then to record yourself reading twenty
      different English words. The process should take less than ten minutes.
      There are no known risks to participation in the study; participation is
      voluntary, and you may decline to answer any questions you choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The audio files you submit will be available through the website to any
      user, and these files will be linked to your background information. We
      are not collecting names and your data will therefore be anonymous and
      your confidentiality protected. However, given that your voice could be
      recognized by others, you should be aware that it may be possible for some
      users to identify your data. If you complete the recording task but later
      decide you donot want your audio included, please contact us and we will
      remove the data.
