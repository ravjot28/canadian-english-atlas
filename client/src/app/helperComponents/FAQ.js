    How do I make a recording? To record and submit your voice, click on the
    "Add Audio" tab and follow the prompts. Please note that this feature only
    works when using Chrome as your browser. How do I listen to a recording? To
    listen to a recording, click on a marker, choose the word you want to hear,
    and please "play". Why did you choose these words? The words in the
    recording list were chosen to highlight different areas of possible dialect
    variation. For example.... Why are you only collecting English samples?
    Canada has two official languages - English and French, dozens of Indigenous
    languages and many more heritage languages of immigrant communities. We
    focus on English here because the mandate of the Strathy Language Unit is to
    explore the English language in Canada. You can find an online atlas of
    Algonquin languages of Canada here. We hope maps of other languages will
    follow! Why do you ask demographic questions such as age and gender? The
    pronunciation of a word is based on many factors. Some of these factors are
    linguistic, such as how the quality of a vowel is impacting by the sounds
    the proceed and follow, whether the syllable is stressed, etc. Some of these
    factors are sociolinguistic, including a speaker's age, gender, ethnicity,
    education and a number of others. Collecting this information allows users
    to explore if and how these factors may contribute to differences observed
    in the map data.
